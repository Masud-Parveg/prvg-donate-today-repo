                <p class="top-paragrap"> An estimated 7.2 million people are affected by this sudden flash flood and water congestion in seven
                north-eastern districts of Sylhet, Sunamganj, Moulivazar, Habiganj, Kishorganj, Netrakona and Brahman Baria. Among the seven districts, five heavily impacted are Sylhet, Sunamganj, Moulivazar, Habiganj and Netrakona. The floods hit at a time when affected communities were still recovering from unseasonal floods in late May 2022. Some 459,567 people have been evacuated to 1,432 safety centres. 
                Regular water source at high risk of contamination with microorganisms, sewage, heating oil, agricultural or industrial waste, chemicals and other substances, sanitation facilities are poor and unhygienic, all can cause serious illness and putting strain on the already affected health facilities. 
                We are reaching out for your support in our bid to raise money for those affected by the floods in Bangladesh.

            <h1>Parvez Hasan in aid of the flood-affected in Bangladesh</h1>
            <p>Parvez Hasan, a familiar face on Facebook and YouTube, has already captured the hearts of thousands with his thoughtful social media posts. In his videos, he highlights the lives of the underprivileged people of the peripheries and helps them in various ways.
             At present, when people of Sylhet, Sunamganj and Kurigram are affected by the devastating floods. Parvez Hasan has taken numerous steps to stand by the flood victims along with many other compassionate individuals of the country.According to Hasan, Founder of Sohomormita Foundation, and Volunteer Coordinator at BIN Network Foundation, they were able to distribute, jaggery, flat rice, puffed rice, distilled water and emergency medicine in the first few days. Then the realisation hit them that the victims, already in an uncomfortable situation, perhaps preferred traditional food over uncustomary, dry food. "This is when we started to cook for them," said Hasan</p>
